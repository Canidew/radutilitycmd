# radutilitycmd

just typed up a basic cmd file to automate some stuff i need to do regularly

good ol marcus told me to upload here so if anybody wants it, go for it, though im not sure how much i can suggest trusting
my terrible scripting

i might streamline it at some point but for now it only has 2 pages and 7 options so its not like its lifethreatening
